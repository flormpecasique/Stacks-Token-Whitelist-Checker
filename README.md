The Stacks Token Whitelist Checker is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help you easily verify whether a Stacks token contract is part of the official whitelist. By entering a token contract address, the app queries the Hiro API to provide a fast and reliable check. This helps users avoid potential scams and ensures that they interact with only trusted and verified tokens on the Stacks blockchain. Ideal for developers, traders, and anyone involved in the Stacks ecosystem looking for security and transparency.
