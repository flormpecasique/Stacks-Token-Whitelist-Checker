The Stacks Token Whitelist Checker is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help you easily verify whether a Stacks token contract is part of the official whitelist. By entering a token contract address, the app queries both the Hiro API and a verified list of tokens from stxtools.io to provide a fast and reliable check. This ensures that users can avoid potential scams and interact only with trusted and verified tokens on the Stacks blockchain. Ideal for developers, traders, and anyone involved in the Stacks ecosystem who values security and transparency.
